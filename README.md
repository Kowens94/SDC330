# Project Name: Employee Management System
## Project Description
The Employee Management System is a modular Java application designed to help users manage employee records across multiple types. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The system includes features like interactive menu logic, subclass-specific output formatting, and extensible helper methods.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Design the class hierarchy**
  - Create an abstract `Employee` superclass
  - Define subclasses for full-time, salaried, and contract employees
- **Task 2: Implement employee-specific fields**
  - Add salary for salaried employees
  - Add hourly rate and weekly hours for full-time employees
  - Add contractor name and contract duration for contract employees
- **Task 3: Build the employee database**
  - Create an array or list to store employee objects
  - Implement insertion and lookup logic
- **Task 4: Develop output formatting**
  - Create helper methods for printing headers and employee info
  - Format output to adapt to subclass-specific fields
- **Task 5: Create interactive menu logic**
  - Build a console-based interface for adding and editing employees
  - Validate user input and handle subclass-specific edits
- **Task 6: Test the application**
  - Add sample employees and verify output formatting
  - Debug casting and formatting issues
- **Task 7: Document the project**
  - Write class-level and method-level comments
  - Create a README file for GitHub

## Project Skills Learned
- Object-oriented design with inheritance and polymorphism
- Java class structure and access control
- Output formatting and conditional logic
- Interactive console menu development
- Safe casting and subclass-specific validation
- Writing maintainable and extensible helper methods
- Technical documentation and commenting best practices

## Language Used
- **Java**: For all class definitions, logic, and output formatting

## Development Process Used
- **Iterative Refinement**: Emphasizing step-by-step debugging, formatting improvements, and subclass extensibility

## Notes
- Ensure all `.java` files are compiled before running the application
- Use `javac *.java` to compile all source files
- Run the application using `java EmployeeApp`
- Customize output formatting by editing helper methods in `EmployeeDatabase`
- Extend functionality by adding new employee types and menu options
